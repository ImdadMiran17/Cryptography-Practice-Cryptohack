> In Python, the `chr()` function can be used to convert an ASCII ordinal number to a character (the `ord()` function does the opposite).

> In Python, the `bytes.fromhex()` function can be used to convert hex to bytes. The `.hex()` instance method can be called on byte strings to get the hex representation.

> In Python, after importing the base64 module with `import base64`, you can use the `base64.b64encode()` function. Remember to decode the hex first as the challenge description states.
